What is Scala?,"# Scala Study Notes

Scala is a programming language that combines object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It runs on the JVM and is statically typed.
", ""
What does the name "Scala" mean?,"It comes from "scalable language" - designed to grow with the demands of its users.
", ""
What is immutability?,"Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. In Scala, this is achieved using `val` instead of `var`.
", "Basic Concepts"
Why use immutable data structures?,"Benefits include:
- Thread safety without locks
- Easier to reason about code
- Prevention of unexpected side effects
- Better support for functional programming

Multiple paragraphs work too!

", "Basic Concepts"
How do you define a case class?,"```scala
case class Person(name: String, age: Int)
val john = Person("John", 30)
```

Case classes automatically get apply, unapply, copy, equals, hashCode, and toString methods.
", "Code Examples"
What is pattern matching in Scala?,"```scala
value match {
  case Some(x) => println(s"Got $x")
  case None => println("Got nothing")
}
```

It's similar to switch statements but much more powerful.
", "Code Examples"
What is a monad?,"A monad is a type class with two operations: `flatMap` (or `bind`) and `pure` (or `unit`). It represents computations as a series of steps.

Common monads include Option, List, Future, and Either.
", "Advanced Topics"
What is the difference between `map` and `flatMap`?,"`map` transforms the value inside a wrapper, while `flatMap` transforms and flattens nested wrappers. For example, `List(1,2,3).map(x => List(x, x*2))` gives `List(List(1,2), List(2,4), List(3,6))`, but with `flatMap` it gives `List(1,2,2,4,3,6)`.
", "Q&A Format Section"
What is a higher-order function?,"A function that takes other functions as parameters or returns a function as a result.
", "Q&A Format Section"
How do you handle errors in functional programming?,"Using types like Option, Either, or Try instead of exceptions:
```scala
def divide(a: Int, b: Int): Option[Int] = 
  if (b == 0) None else Some(a / b)
```
", "Q&A Format Section"
What about questions with quotes?,"She said "Hello world!" and he replied "Hi there!" - quotes should be escaped in CSV.
", "Edge Cases"
What if there's a comma, in the question?,"The answer also has commas, semicolons; and other punctuation: that needs proper CSV escaping!
", "Edge Cases"
Questions with "special" characters: <, >, &, etc.?,"These need to be handled properly: 5 < 10, x > y, this & that.
", "Empty answers are valid too"
What about very long answers that span multiple paragraphs?,"This is the first paragraph of a long answer.

This is the second paragraph. Some flashcard systems handle this fine.

And here's a third paragraph for good measure.
", "Empty answers are valid too"
Multi-line code blocks,"```scala
object Example {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, world!")
    
    val numbers = List(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val doubled = numbers.map(_ * 2)
    
    doubled.foreach(println)
  }
}
```

Code blocks can have empty lines and indentation that should be preserved.
", "Empty answers are valid too"
Can you mix header and Q: formats in the same document?,"Yes! A good parser should handle both.
", "Mixed Q&A Format"
What about inline `code` in questions?,"Inline code like `flatMap` or `Option[T]` should work in both questions and answers.
", "Mixed Q&A Format"
Does inline `code` work in Q:/A: format too?,"Yes, like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` - all should be preserved.
", "Mixed Q&A Format"
What if ## appears in the answer text?,"The answer might reference markdown syntax like "use ## for headers" - this shouldn't be treated as a new question!

##What if there's no space after the hash?
This should probably still be recognized as a question (user error).
", "Tricky Edge Cases"
What about extra spaces?,"     This answer has weird indentation but should still work.
", "Tricky Edge Cases"
Final question with answer,"This is the last card in the deck.
", "Another question without an answer?"
Last Q: format question,"Last answer!
", "What about trailing Q: without A:?"
What is **bold** and *italic* text?,"Markdown allows **bold** with double asterisks and *italic* with single asterisks. These might get preserved or stripped depending on your parser.
", "Special formatting"
How about lists in answers?,"Lists work like this:
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
", "Special formatting"
What about émojis 🚀 and ünïcödé?,"Modern flashcard tools should handle UTF-8: café, naïve, 日本語, 你好, مرحبا
", "Unicode and special characters"
Code without language specified,"```
// Code block without language tag
function hello() {
  return "world";
}
```
", "Unicode and special characters"
What about nested lists?,"- Top level
    - Nested level
        - Deep nested
- Back to top
", "Nested markdown structures"
Do nested code blocks work?,"Code in code might be tricky:
```
outer code
  inner code
    very nested
```
", "Nested markdown structures"
Question with tab character,"Answer with		multiple	tabs	inside.
", "Tab characters and weird whitespace"
Last question,"Last answer - make sure this gets captured even at EOF!", "End of document edge case"
